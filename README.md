# Tasks with Angular, NG-ZORRO and Tailwind CSS

This project is a task list application created with **Angular**, **NG-ZORRO** and **Tailwind CSS**. It allows adding, editing, deleting and marking tasks as completed. The data is stored in the `localStorage` of the browser so that tasks persist between sessions.

## Features

- Add tasks**: You can add new tasks to the list.
- Edit tasks**: You can edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks**: You can delete tasks you no longer need.
- Mark tasks as completed**: You can mark tasks as completed, which will visually mark them with a cut line.
- **Browser persistence**: Tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so they are maintained even after closing the browser or reloading the page.

## Technologies used

- Angular**: Framework to build the application.
- **NG-ZORRO**: Angular UI component library based on Ant Design.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility design framework for quick style customization.
